# :moneybag: Checkout Store Solution :moneybag:

## :memo: Problem to solve: 
Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:

* The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on VOUCHER items.
* The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more TSHIRT items, the price per unit should be 19.00â‚¬.

Checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid. Using ES6, implement a checkout process that fulfills the requirements.
